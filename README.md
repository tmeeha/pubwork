# pubwork
Portable shiny app for making NEON publication workbooks, 
readme files, and variables files.

1. Download the 'PubWorkApp' directory to anywhere you'd like
on your local computer.

2. Start up RStudio, and make sure the shiny package is 
installed.

3. From RStudio, navigate to the 'PubWorkApp' directory and
open the 'ui.R' file.

3. From RStudio, navigate to the 'PubWorkApp' directory and
open the 'server.R' file.

4. Once these two files are open in RStudio, you should see 
a green arrow in the top-right corner of the editor window,
with a label that says 'Run App'.

5. Click that button and the app will start. Note that 
there are two tabs, one for publication workbooks, and one
for readme and variables files. Publication workbook names
are an input to the readme and variables code.  So it makes
sense make these first.

6. Enter information into fields on the left side, getting 
help from the sidebar on the right side.

7. The completed publication workbook template, readme 
template, and variables files will be added to the '
PubWorkApp' directory.
